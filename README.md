# sysmon-install
In this repository I will be doing a walk through of how to install sysmon on a Windows virtual machine.

In this setup I will be running a Windows 10 Virtual machine on Vmware. The iso file for this machine can be downloaded from the following link:

https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-windows-10-enterprise.html

After the virtual machine is set up we want to open a browser and navigate to the following link:

learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

You should see this screen when you open up the link
